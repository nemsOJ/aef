To perform an operation, enter the corresponding number. The following explain briefly what each action does.

Note: Ensure that you load an FSA before attempting operations that depend on an existing FSA. Follow the specific instructions for each option and respond to prompts to successfully perform various operations.

1. Create an FSA
   - Select option 1 from the main menu.
   - Follow the instructions to define states, transitions, and input/output symbols.

2. Import an FSA from a file
   - Select option 2 from the main menu.
   - Enter the filename to import.
   - Ensure the file follows the expected format for an FSA.

3. Display an FSA
   - Select option 3 from the main menu.
   - Displays the automaton on the screen if it has already been created.

4. Verify if a word is recognized by the FSA
   - Select option 4 from the main menu.
   - Indicates whether a word is recognized by the loaded FSA.

5. Check if the FSA is complete
   - Select option 5 from the main menu.
   - Indicates whether the loaded FSA is complete.

6. Make the FSA complete
   - Select option 6 from the main menu.
   - Modifies the FSA to make it complete.

7. Check if the FSA is deterministic
   - Select option 7 from the main menu.
   - Indicates whether the loaded FSA is deterministic.

8. Make the FSA deterministic
   - Select option 8 from the main menu.
   - Modifies the FSA to make it deterministic.

9. Create the complement of an FSA
   - Select option 9 from the main menu.
   - Creates the complement of the loaded FSA.

10. Create the mirror of an FSA
    - Select option 10 from the main menu.
    - Creates the mirror of the loaded FSA.

11. Create the Regular Expression of an FSA
    - Select option 11 from the main menu.
    - Generates the regular expression corresponding to the loaded FSA.

12. Create the Pruned FSA of an FSA
    - Select option 12 from the main menu.
    - Generates the pruned FSA from the loaded FSA.

13. Multiply two FSAs
    - Select option 13 from the main menu.
    - Enter the name of the second FSA to multiply.

14. Concatenate two FSAs
    - Select option 14 from the main menu.
    - Enter the name of the second FSA to concatenate.

15. Check if two FSAs are Equivalent
    - Select option 15 from the main menu.
    - Enter the name of the second FSA to compare for equivalence.

0. Exit the program
   - Select option 0 from the main menu.
   - Terminates the execution of the program.
